This is the source code directory for our Accent Recognition System developed for Stanford's CS229 final project.

The source code is primarily subdivided into two directories:
1. classical_ml - This directory contains the code base for our implementation of two Classical ML models used as baseline models for our accent recognition system.
2. cnn_dl - This directory contains the code base for our implementation of the accent recognition system.
