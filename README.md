## CS229 Project - Accent Recognition System ##
Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are widely used for speech- to-text conversion required in closed-captioning (on platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and
Vimeo), home assistants (such as Alexa) and personal virtual assistants (such as Siri and Google Assistant). Furthermore, this technology enables hands-free computing used by able-bodied users and more importantly, necessary for users with disabilities. This gives rise to the need for Accent Recognition systems
that integrate with Speech Recognition algorithms to achieve fairness in the learning models, and improve accuracy. This project aims to use **Classical ML and DL techniques** to classify accents of non-native speakers of English.

The project uses the [L2-ARCTIC corpus](https://psi.engr.tamu.edu/l2-arctic-corpus/) database.
